//- Given an int variable n that has already been declared and initialized to a positive value
//- Another int variable j that has already been declared
//- Use a for loop to print a single line consisting of n STARS.
//- Thus if n contains 5, five STARS will be printed
//- Use no variables other than n and j.
//
//HINT: NO NEED FOR ARRAY HERE, JUST USE WHILE LOOP
